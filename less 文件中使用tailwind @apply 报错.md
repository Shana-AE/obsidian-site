Hey! This looks specific to Less, if you removeÂ `lang="less"`Â it works. Less must be compiling it in a way where it is either removing theÂ `[20px]`Â part before Tailwind processes it, or adding a space after theÂ `p-`Â part.

Going to close as not a Tailwind issue unfortunately, nothing we can really do here. In general we recommend avoiding using any preprocessor with Tailwind:
